      faqQue: `What kind of server is Plesk?`,
      faqAns: `Although it can be installed on different servers, Plesk is a control panel program rather than a server. It can be set up on a dedicated server, virtual private server (VPS), or shared hosting server. With Plesk, you can manage web hosting, domain names, email accounts, and other relevant services from a single web interface.`,

      faqQue: `How could I modify the Plesk control panel's default page?`,
      faqAns: `If you are using Plesk as your control panel, you can modify the default page by following these steps: Log in to your Plesk control panel. Go to the "Tools & Settings" page. Click on the "Custom Error Pages" option under the "Security" section. Find the "Default Page" section and click on the "Edit" button next to it. In the "Default Page" settings, you can modify the HTML code of the default page to match your requirements. You can use the built-in editor or upload a custom HTML file. Save the changes and the new default page will be applied. Note that if you need to customize error pages for specific codes, you can do so using the same process.`,
