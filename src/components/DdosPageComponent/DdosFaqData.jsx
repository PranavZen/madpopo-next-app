      faqQue: `How does the MadPopo DDoS protection work?`,
      faqAns: `MadPopo's DDoS protection system is designed to automatically identify and detect most DDoS attack patterns, and subsequently filter incoming traffic to the server. This allows the system to drop any malicious traffic that may be part of the attack, while allowing only genuine and desired traffic to reach the server. As a MadPopo customer, you will not experience any noticeable disruption during a potential attack, as our DDoS protection system works seamlessly in the background to filter out any malicious traffic. In essence, the MadPopo DDoS protection provides a reliable and efficient way to safeguard your online services against potential DDoS attacks.      `

      faqQue: `How Do I Choose the Right WordPress Hosting Plan?`,
      faqAns: `The resources allotted and available in the various MadPopo WordPress hosting plans vary. We propose our StarterBoost plan for regularly occurring sites that are just getting started, sites that do not keep a sizable database, and/or sites that do not receive a lot of traffic.

      faqQue: `What are the limits of MadPopo DDoS protection?`,
      faqAns: `Although the MadPopo DDoS protection is designed to recognize and filter 99% of all attack patterns, it does have its limits like any other DDoS protection available on the internet. While the majority of DDoS attacks are mitigated, there are some attacks that cannot be filtered due to their unique pattern or volume. Although it is unlikely that your server will be affected by attacks that our DDoS protection cannot filter, we are continually working to improve our protection system to address these challenges in the near future. Please be aware that the MadPopo DDoS protection, like any other DDoS protection, does not guarantee full protection against every conceivable DDoS attack.`,
